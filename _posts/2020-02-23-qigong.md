## Yi Jin Jing 易筋經

Yi Jin Jing is a method to develop strong and flexible muscles and tendons. It is therefore also called "Muscle and Tendon Change Classic".
- Yi - Change
- Jin - Tendons
- Jing - Methods

It belongs to the classic repertoire of Qi Gong exercises in the Shaolin Arts around the globe. 
Together with the 8 brocades (Ba Duan Jin) and the meditative circular movements (Chan Yuan Gong) it gives a strong foundation to complete all martial exercises.
